A lot of times, when we are developing a website or blog on wordpress, we would need to create a lot of categories. 

Sometimes, it becomes a pain to create categories one by one. So, here is a plugin which allows a list of comma separated categories to be copy pasted in a textarea. And on clicking a button, all the categories are loaded into the wordpress categories section in a single go.

So, you do not need to sit and click on the Add New Category button for every category that has to be created.
